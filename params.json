You can search one keyword and one month at a time. Results will be saved as a html file named after the search term and month.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nI wanted a way to quickly see who in the open knowledge community has been discussing a certain issue (in my case, privacy and personal data). Google search didn't return all the relevant / recent messages, so I decided to write my own tool for this. Hopefully this can facilitate collaboration and communication between different groups. For instance, the privacy / personal data specialists can use this to monitor when these issues crop up in other working groups and get in touch to offer help and guidance.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
