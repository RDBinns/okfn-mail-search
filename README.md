### Search okfn mailing list messages by keyword

This python script will search a month's worth of publicly archived mailing list messages for a keyword, and return links to all the individual messages containing that keyword. You can search one keyword and one month at a time. Results will be saved as a html file named after the search term and month.

### Why?

I wanted a way to quickly see who in the open knowledge community has been discussing a certain issue (in my case, privacy and personal data). Google search didn't return all the relevant / recent messages, so I decided to write my own tool for this. Hopefully this can facilitate collaboration and communication between different groups. For instance, the privacy / personal data specialists can use this to monitor when these issues crop up in other working groups and get in touch to offer help and guidance.
